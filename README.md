# Sudoku Puzzle Solver

## Backtracking Algorithm
### Backtracking is a technique to solve problems where multiple choices are there and we donâ€™t know the correct choice and hence we solve the problem with trial and error i.e. trying each option until goal is achieved.

## How the algorithm works?
### The main algorithm in this particular sudoku solver is the recursive solveSudoku method. The solving begins when the solve method is called on a 9x9 array of ints representing the sudoku puzzle that is to be solved. Every time solveSudoku is called, the algorithm inputs a valid number into the next cell of the Sudoku grid and calls the solveSudoku method on that resulting Sudoku grid. The algorithm "backtracks" when it reaches a point at which there are no valid numbers for a particular cell. At that point, the algorithm swaps its previous cell entry for a different valid value and continues filling in the grid as described. At last, the algorithm will have found every possible solution to a given puzzle, since the program ultimately inputs and thereby tests ALL valid values for a particular cell.
